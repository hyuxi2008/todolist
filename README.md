A simple todolist API
=====================

A simple API to create/read/update/delete, mark as done/undone and search todo tasks.

You can easily configure it by editing /src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/todolist.properties

Once running on your servlet container (tested with Tomcat 8) you can test the API 
by running /src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/TodolistTest. 
Setup the endpoint and the key for the test by editing test.properties
